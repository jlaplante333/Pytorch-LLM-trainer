# Pytorch LLM trainer

# I am in the process of uploading LLM related code and experiments that I have done on my laptop and not shared on Github. 
# This file shows how to train an LLN using Pytorch. The entire process is: preparing the dataset and prerequisites, setting up the trainer, and running the training process.
# This is a very simple example. WARNING: It will run very slowly on your local machine.
